In so doing, provision is made for a nitrogen oxide production unit separated from the combustion source and its exhaust gas duct and a hydrogen production unit separated from the combustion source and its exhaust gas duct; and nitrogen oxide of the nitrogen oxide production unit and the hydrogen of the hydrogen production unit are delivered at least to a storage catalytic converter or a nitrogen oxide storage and a subsequently connected catalytic converter for the storage of the nitrogen oxide and for the formation of ammonia. The invention concerns additionally a procedure for the production of ammonia as a reducing agent for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas of a combustion source, especially of an internal combustion engine, whereby the ammonia is admixed with the exhaust gas in the direction of flow in front of a SCR-catalytic converter. In so doing, nitrogen oxide is produced in a nitrogen oxide production unit separate from the combustion source an its exhaust gas duct and is stored in at least one storage catalytic converter or a nitrogen oxide storage and a subsequently connected catalytic converter. Furthermore, hydrogen and/or a hydrogen-carbon monoxide-mixture is produced in a hydrogen production unit separated from the combustion source and its exhaust gas duct and delivered to a storage catalytic converter. Hydrogen and the stored nitrogen oxide are converted catalytically to ammonia in the storage catalytic converter or in the catalytic converter. Device and procedure allow for a self-sufficient production of ammonia outside of the exhaust gas tract of the combustion source and without an intervention into the operating parameters of the combustion source, whereby operating resources normally transported exclusively in a motor vehicle are used.";"B01D 53/9409 (2013.01)

This material can also be used to repair certain small irregularities on the enforced objects surface. The prepreg band and adhesive can be prepared, used and hardened where the enforced objects are, and while the objects are fully operating, even if the temperature is relatively cold at about 0° C. The opportune choice of initiators and the substances added to the prepreg's matrix material: poly-epsilon-caprolacton; the acetyl-acetone and alkyl-(acrylate)-methacrylate type monomers added to the adhesive result in the networking of the resins. The peroxides decompose due to the activator compounds coming from diffusion on the surface of the adhesive substance. This process ensures the complete hardening of the composite band on the whole surface it is applied and the homogeneity of the assumption of load.";"C08J 5/06 (2013.01)

The separate data memory area (205) can have the size from ten megabytes to a few gigabytes and can be used for storing audio/video data, audio data or application programs for the digital television decoder. The card also comprises a conditional access circuit (207) for descrambling of data stored in the separate data memory area (205), and a controller (206) for controlling the data flow inside the card. The controller (206) allows replay of data from the separate data memory when the conditions for replay of data, stored separately for each data file, are met.";"H04N 5/76 (2013.01)

The process comprises the steps of forming a supercritical solvent containing ion or ions of alkali metals in an autoclave; and dissolving a monocrystalline gallium nitride prepared by flux methods as a feedstock in this supercritical solvent to form a supercritical solution, and simultaneously or separately recrystallizing gallium nitride on the face of a seed.";"C30B 29/403 (2013.01)

The tag analysis block ( 121 ) is provided with a configuration table ( 122 ) for storing configuration data for various types of recordings, defining distances of searching and storing tags. In this system a user tag is inserted at a place of existing tag when an existing tag distance is shorter or equal to a predefined tag searching distance. Otherwise, when there is no existing tag within the predefined tag searching distance, the user tag is inserted at the predefined tag searching distance.";"G06F 17/30817 (2013.01)
